The process begins when a patient or hospital submits a blood request by entering the required blood group, location, hospital name, contact details, and urgency level.
Once the request is submitted, the system analyzes the request and searches the donor database. It filters donors based on matching blood group, nearby location (within a selected radius), availability status, and eligibility to donate (minimum gap since last donation).
After filtering, the system sorts the matched donors based on priority factors such as closest distance, availability, and most recent activity. The best-matched donors are then shortlisted.
Emergency notifications are sent to these matched donors.
If a donor accepts the request, their contact details are securely shared with the patient or hospital.
The donor then connects with the patient or hospital and proceeds with the blood donation.
Finally, the system updates the request status as completed and records the donation.
